SQL Project: Student Course Management
Project Overview
This project involves creating a database to manage student course information. The database will include tables for students, courses, enrollments, and instructors. This project is designed to help you learn and practice SQL through various tasks including database setup, table creation, data insertion, and query formulation.

Project Requirements

Courses

course_id (Primary Key, INT, AUTO_INCREMENT)
course_name (VARCHAR)
course_description (TEXT)
Instructors

instructor_id (Primary Key, INT, AUTO_INCREMENT)
first_name (VARCHAR)
last_name (VARCHAR)
email (VARCHAR)
Enrollments

enrollment_id (Primary Key, INT, AUTO_INCREMENT)
